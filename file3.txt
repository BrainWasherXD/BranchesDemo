king went deep in forest and found a spaceship. He went inside and   found a alien boss meditating. The alien boss opened his eyes and asked the king, “Who are you?” The king replied, “I am a king and I am lost in the forest. I am hungry and thirsty. Can you help me?” The alien boss said, “I can help you. I have a cow. I will give you milk to drink and you can eat the fruits from the trees around.” The king was very happy. He drank the milk and ate the fruits. He thanked the alien boss and asked him, “Can I stay here for some time?” The alien boss said, “Yes, you can stay here as long as you want.” The king stayed in the spaceship for many days. He was very happy. He did not want to go back to his kingdom. He wanted to stay in the spaceship forever. The alien boss asked the king, “Why do you want to stay here? You are a king. You have a kingdom to rule. You have people to take care of. You have a family to look after. You have a duty to perform. You cannot stay here forever.” The king realized his mistake. He thanked the alien boss and went back to his kingdom. He ruled his kingdom well and took care of his people. He lived happily ever after.
